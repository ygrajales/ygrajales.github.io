>      "What do you want to be when you grow up?"  This question has a few evolutions - What's your major?  What do you plan to do with your degree? - and its final form - What do you do?  My particular answers have evolved and branched in wildly different ways over the years.
		 The first time I was asked, maybe at four or five, I replied, "a scientist".  I had seen reruns of Mr. Wizard, had done some minor experiments at home (ex. celery in water with food coloring) with parental inspiration and assistance.  Subconsciously, I think I understood whatever career path I chose needed to address my curiosity and desire to create.
		 My introduction to programing began sophomore year of high school, to fulfill the technology graduation requirement. I took Computer Science I (Java).  The next time I took a programming course (about 13 years later), it was an incidental, prerequisite intro to C++ course.  I was shocked - while I did not remember any specific syntax, the basic frameworks of how to program lingered.  Loops, variables, strings - I remembered what they were, if not how to create and utilize them.  I relished that class!  Programming made me feel as if I were magic - creating something from nothing, using words to create things, to communicate through time and space.  My program focused not necessarily on software, but rather programming to manipulate data.  I was not able to finish for personal reasons, but I learned about different statistical programming languages while I was there.  I worked in a different field afterward, but the idea of programming never really went away.  
		 Finally, I felt the need to change my career into something that would last, something that I knew would be fulfilling.  Software engineering fits the description of what I had originally looked for in a vocation - something that stimulates curiosity and facilitates creation.  I feel so lucky to get to study it.
